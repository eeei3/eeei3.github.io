	  <h1>My first update in months</h1>
	  <p> 
	  I have really left this in the mothballs haven't I? Well not anymore.
	  What have I been working on? Mostly school. But I am starting to concentrate
	  more on learning C. I am planning also to learn Lua after I feel confident
	  enough in my C abilities, enough where I feel like I can learn a new language
	  without forsaking another. After Lua I plan to do probably some front end languages.
	  As for C, I am essentially remaking the program redyt, made by Bugswriter. You can find
	  his script on GitHub. I chose to remake this because I thought it was of sufficient
	  difficulty and that I would have also like to use this program, but it has a dwm
	  dependancy. I have a bit of a, philosophy lets call it, where I don't really like
	  dependancies. The fewer the better if you ask me. Unless its something basically everyone
	  has installed, like Python. So to cut down on some dependancies, I have written a focused
	  JSON parser in Python that is made for only this program.</p>
